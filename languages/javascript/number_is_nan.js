 Four number-related functions are already available as global functions
 and have been added to Number, as methods:
 isFinite and isNaN, parseFloat and parseInt.
 All of them work almost the same as their global counterparts,
 but isFinite and isNaN donâ€™t coerce their arguments to numbers, anymore,
 which is especially important for isNaN.
