---

ObjectSpace._id2ref is the inverse of Object.object_id
it takes an object ID as its argument and returns the corresponding object

---

ObjectSpace.define_finalizer allows the registration of a Proc or a block of code to be
invoked when a specified object is garbage collected

ObjectSpace.undefine_finalizer to delete all finalizer blocks registered for an object

Garbage collection can be temporarily disabled with GC.disable, and it can be enabled again with GC.enable .

----

ObjectSpace.garbage_collect # forces Rubyâ€™s garbage collector to run

GC.start is a synonym for ObjectSpace.garbage_collect
